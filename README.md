The above examples clearly indicates the use of inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism and encapsulation
IN SMARTPHONE.PY, it shows how different phones(polymorphism) inherit from phone using (abstract method) spec and for
Encapsulation â†’ object attributes grouped inside each class (though not strictly enforced).

IN VEHICLE(polymorphism)Polymorphism is is displayed thru the move() method which acts as this single interface.
through the calling of the same method name (vehicle.move()), for every object in my list it executes its own specific
and unique implementation of that method.
